# dbt for Data Transformation

## Overview

As the next step in our project, we have implemented data transformation using dbt (Data Build Tool). dbt is a powerful tool that allows us to transform and model our data in a modular and version-controlled manner. We have set up our dbt project locally on the JetBrains Dataspell IDE, and the code is committed to a GitHub repository at [https://github.com/Mohammed-Mebarek-Mecheter/dbtLego](https://github.com/Mohammed-Mebarek-Mecheter/dbtLego).

## Project Structure

The dbt project follows a specific directory structure to organize the different components of the data transformation process. Here's an overview of the project directory:

```
dbtLego/
├── dbt_project.yml
├── packages.yml
├── analyses/
├── macros/
├── seeds/
├── snapshots/
├── target/
├── tests/
├── models/
│   ├── staging/
│   ├── aggregations/
│   ├── transformation/
│   ├── errors/
│   ├── analysis/
│   └── schema.yml
├── README.md
└── profiles.yml
```

- `dbt_project.yml`: The main configuration file for the dbt project.
- `packages.yml`: Configuration file for dbt packages (external dependencies).
- `analyses/`: Directory for storing analysis files.
- `macros/`: Directory for custom macros (reusable SQL functions).
- `seeds/`: Directory for seed data files (e.g., static data, lookups).
- `snapshots/`: Directory for snapshot files (capturing data at a specific point in time).
- `target/`: Directory where the compiled SQL files and documentation are generated.
- `tests/`: Directory for storing data tests.
- `models/`: Directory containing the main dbt models organized into subdirectories.
  - `staging/`: Models for staging raw data.
  - `aggregations/`: Models for aggregating data.
  - `transformation/`: Models for transforming and enriching data.
  - `errors/`: Models for handling errors and data quality issues.
  - `analysis/`: Models for performing advanced analyses.
  - `schema.yml`: Configuration file for defining the model schema.
- `README.md`: The project's README file.
- `profiles.yml`: Configuration file for defining database connections and credentials.

## Features

The dbt project provides several powerful features for data transformation and modeling:

- **Data Modeling**: We can organize and structure the Lego dataset into meaningful models for analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Complex transformations and calculations can be implemented to derive insights from the data.
- **Documentation**: dbt automatically generates documentation for the data models, transformations, and tests.
- **Testing**: We can ensure data integrity and accuracy with automated tests.
- **Version Control**: Changes to the data models and transformations are managed using version control systems like Git.
- **Scalability**: The project can easily scale to handle large datasets and complex analyses.
